# Lab1

  1.  First complete the Worksheet for this Lab.
  2.  Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment for the Lab (Links to an external site.).
  3.  Navigate to your code directory (e.g.: cd my-cs1405-code-dir).
  4.  Run git clone {yourUrl} to make a local copy of your repository. (Reminder, replace {yourUrl} including the brackets with your actual repo url.)
  5.  Run code {nameOfYourRepo} to open that directory in VS Code.
  6.  Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`, or the Terminal menu -> New Terminal).
  7.  Run dotnet new console to create a new project in the current folder.
  8.  Add and commit the initial project to your repository (git add . and git commit -m 'initial commit').
  9.  In VS Code, open the generated 'Program.cs' file.
  10. Work through the instructions and examples in [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/numbers-in-csharp). For each step of the tutorial do the following:
  +      (Links to an external site.)Carefully read the explanations.
  +      Add the example to your Program.cs file and make any tweaks to make sure that the code runs and gives the desired results from the terminal. (We want to be able to see all of the examples running from the same file when you are done.)
  +      Commit and push the changes to github (git commit -am 'finished step: 1' and git push).
  11. Meet with me to review your work.
